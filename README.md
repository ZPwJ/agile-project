## Overview

Agile Project provides a centralized workspace for managing Scrum projects, from maintaining the product backlog to tracking sprint execution.

The application separates business API responsibilities from authentication and authorization, using dedicated services and PostgreSQL databases for application and identity data.

## Features

- **Product Backlog Management** — Organize and maintain the work planned for a project.
- **Sprint Planning** — Manage sprints and their associated backlog items.
- **Kanban Board** — Visualize sprint work and track progress through a board-style interface.
- **Project Management** — Organize projects and their related resources.
- **Issue Management** — Create and manage issues throughout the development workflow.
- **Comments** — Support collaboration through issue-related discussions.
- **Role-Based Access Control** — Protect resources using a separate authentication and authorization server.
- **REST API** — Expose application functionality through a documented HTTP API.
- **OpenAPI Documentation** — Explore endpoints and authorize API requests using JWT bearer tokens.

## Architecture

The application consists of a resource server, a dedicated authentication server, and separate PostgreSQL databases.

### Components

| Component | Responsibility | Local endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| `agile-server` | Spring Boot resource server and REST API | `http://localhost:8081` |
| `auth-server` | Authentication and authorization infrastructure | `http://localhost:8080` |
| Application PostgreSQL | Stores application data | Internal Docker network |
| Authentication PostgreSQL | Stores authentication-related data | Internal Docker network |

The services and databases are orchestrated through Docker Compose.

## Technology Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Java 21 | Backend runtime |
| Spring Boot | Backend application framework |
| PostgreSQL | Relational database |
| Docker | Containerization |
| Docker Compose | Local multi-service orchestration |
| JWT / Bearer Authentication | API request authentication |
| OpenAPI | REST API documentation |

*The stack above reflects the technologies identified in the project configuration. Additional frameworks and libraries may be present in the individual modules.*

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

**Java 21 is only required if you want to run the Spring Boot module directly on your machine rather than inside Docker.**

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd agile-project
```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of your Git repository.

### 2. Start the application

Run the following command from the repository root:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml up --build
```

Docker Compose builds and starts the application services and their database containers.

To run the stack in the background:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml up --build -d
```

### 3. Verify the services

Once the services have started, the main endpoints are:

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Resource server | [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) |
| Authentication server | [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) |
| OpenAPI UI | [http://localhost:8081/docs.html](http://localhost:8081/docs.html) |
| OpenAPI specification | [http://localhost:8081/api-docs](http://localhost:8081/api-docs) |

The API may require authentication for protected endpoints.

### 4. Stop the application

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml down
```

To remove the containers and associated Compose-managed volumes, use:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml down -v
```

**Warning:** The `-v` option removes associated volumes and can permanently delete locally stored database data.

## Authentication

Agile Project uses a separate authentication and authorization server to issue access tokens for protected API requests.

### Realm configuration

The authentication server imports its initial realm configuration from:

```text
infrastructure/auth-server/realm-export.json
```

The imported configuration defines the following realm and client:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Realm | `agile-project` |
| Client ID | `agile-project-server` |
| Token endpoint | `http://localhost:8080/realms/agile-project/protocol/openid-connect/token` |

### Sample accounts
